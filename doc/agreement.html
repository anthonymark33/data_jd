<h2>Jd Commercial Support Agreement</h2>
<p>Commercial users must have a Jd Commercial Support Agreement (CSA) with Jsoftware.</p>

<p>A CSA provides high-priority, direct access to the J/Jd development and support team.</p>

<p>CSA fees are in US dollars, annual, and payable in advance.</p>

<p>CSA fees are for a single company with a designated primary contact
who is familiar with J, Jd, and the applications.
A company with diverse applications covered by different contacts
needs a separate CSA for each contact.</p>
</p>

<p>CSA fees can be terminated after the second payment. Termination notice must be given
before a payment is due. After termination, the company can continue to use Jd with
the same support available to non-commercial users.</p>

<p>The J forums provide first line support to all Jd users.</p>

<h2>Premium</h2>
<p>Premium fee: $12,000</p>

<p>Premium includes unrestricted use of the
C source for the Jd binary (jd.dll/so/dylib)
that is at the heart of Jd performance. The C source for the
Jd binary is not included in the JAL distribution of Jd
and is available only to Premium users.</p>

<h2>Standard</h2>
<p>Standard fee: $6,000</p>

<h2>Reduced</h2>
<p>Reduced fee: $2,000</p>

<p>A company can provide justification and request a reduced fee.
The reduced fee is available at the discretion of Jsoftware.
A reduced fee automatically increases to the Standard fee after two payments
unless an extension is requested and granted.</p>



<h2>Keeping it real simple</h2>
<p>Jsoftware provides no CSA paperwork or boilerplate.
If you require more formality, we'll consider anything you provide.</p>

<p>Just send us an email that indicates company, contact info, designated primary
contact, and CSA type.<p>

<p>In response we will send an invoice for the CSA and you can start commercial
use of Jd as soon as we receive payment.</p>
