in progress:

zip/unzip ops

*********************************************
not started:

jcs server should have jbin support

derived cols
 csvwr/csvdump need option to not dump derived cols
 csvrestore should detect derived cols are missing and do createdcol 

admin.ijs '<DAN>' - not hardwired

CSVFOLDER parameter
csvwr colsep,rowsep,quotes,escape parameters
easier automated csv load

epoch - flag to allow mm/dd/yy order

insert /missing to allow missing cols

read /nub to return only unique rows

decorate read result header with type 
 cola -> cola-edatime
 colb -> colb-byte 4
 colc -> colc-int1
 - _ or blank separator?
 alias and aggs need thought
 aggs need thought
 possibly useful in csvwr as well
